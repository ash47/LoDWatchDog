Legends of Dota Watch Dog
=========================

###What does this do?###
 - This is a bare basic watchdog for an LoD server
 - Start this executable
 - If SRCDS has an engine error, for example `Engine error: ED_Alloc: no free edicts` this will kill SRCDS so it is free to restart

###How do I get a copy?###
 - Either download the source and compile it, or download the latest binary from the releases section
